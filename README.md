# Simple.Wpf.DataGrid
=====================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2gustf15hmt9tw09/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/simple-wpf-datagrid)

As with all my 'important' stuff it builds using the amazing [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/simple-wpf-datagrid).

The app is skinned using [Mah Apps](http://mahapps.com/).

As with my other projects this is *opinionated software* on the way to build a modern UI in WPF, this example is around a dynamically updating data grid (blotter). It's built without using an third party libraries for the data grid, not because I don't think they do the job required, but because I wanted to see want could be done without any. For me the thrid party libraries have their place, they provide UI's around filtering, sorting, grouping etc out of the box.

The UI's built using MVVM as the MVC architecture and being 'pure' about the separation between the View & View Model etc.
