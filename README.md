# Simple.Wpf.DataGrid
=====================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2gustf15hmt9tw09/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/simple-wpf-datagrid)

As with all my 'important' stuff it builds using the amazing [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/simple-wpf-datagrid).

The app is skinned using [Mah Apps](http://mahapps.com/).

As with my other projects this is *opinionated software* on the way to build a modern UI in WPF, this example is around a dynamically updating data grid (blotter). It's built without using an third party libraries for the data grid, not because I don't think they do the job required, but because I wanted to see want could be done without any. For me the thrid party libraries have their place, they provide UI's around filtering, sorting, grouping etc out of the box.
